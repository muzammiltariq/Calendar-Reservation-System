Getting Started
---------------
This is the frontend of a calendar reservation system created using AngularJS.
The backend for this can be downloaded from [here](https://bitbucket.org/mpopatia/reservation-calendar/src/master/)

Clone this frontend using this command
```
git clone https://github.com/muzammiltariq/Calendar-Reservation-System.git
```

Install the package dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, start the application server by running this command:

```
npm start
```
The frontend server then starts up on http://localhost:8000

The backend of the project runs on http://localhost:3000

Both should be running for this to work
